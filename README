# Multi-Tenant CRM API

This project is a simple backend API for a CRM system where multiple organizations use the same application securely.

Each organization’s data is fully isolated, so users can only access information that belongs to their own organization.

## What this project does

- Lets users register and log in
- Uses JWT for authentication
- Stores the user’s organization inside the token
- Protects all data using organization_id
- Prevents access to other organizations’ data

## Technology used

- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- SQLAlchemy
- JWT authentication
- Uvicorn server

## How security works

- Passwords are hashed before saving
- JWT token is required for protected routes
- Every request is checked against the user’s organization
- Cross-organization access is not allowed

## Available APIs

- Register and Login
- Get current user
- Create contacts
- View contacts (only for the user’s organization)

## How to run the project

venv\Scripts\activate  
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
